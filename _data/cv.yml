      description:
        - (i) Proposed the architecture for a stochastic spaceflight campaign planning based on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and mixed‑integer linear programming (MILP).
        - (ii) Solved a concurrent optimization problem of space transportation planning and spacecraft design (mixed-integer nonlinear programming, MINLP), by decoupling the problem into mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) through augmented Lagrangian coordination (ALC).

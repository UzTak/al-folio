I am an undergraduate student at <b>Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Aerospace Engineering</b> (expected graduation: May 2023), currently intending to enter a Ph.D. program in Fall 2023. 

My research interests include:

- Space mission design (astrodynamics & space logistics)
- Sequential decision-making (optimal control, reinforcement learning, etc.)
- Optimization under uncertainty.

I am currently working at [Georgia Tech Space System Optimization Group](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/)(advisor: Dr. Koki Ho), and [Georgia Tech Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory](https://dcsl.gatech.edu/)(advisor: Dr. Panagiotis Tsiotras). I am a former visiting student researcher at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Section 312A, Project Systems Engineering & Formulation) and Tokyo Metropolitan University.

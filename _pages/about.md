I am an undergraduate student at <b>Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Aerospace Engineering</b> and an incoming Ph.D. student at <b>Stanford University, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</b>. 

I am also a recipient of a full-ride scholarship from [Ezoe Memorial Recruit Foundation](https://www.recruit-foundation.org/) since 2020, which will be continued until the academic year 2027-2028. 

My research interests include:

- Space mission design (astrodynamics & space logistics)
- Sequential decision-making (optimal control, reinforcement learning)
- Optimization under uncertainty.

I am currently working at [Georgia Tech Space System Optimization Group](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/) (advisor: Dr. Koki Ho), and [Georgia Tech Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory](https://dcsl.gatech.edu/) (advisor: Dr. Panagiotis Tsiotras). I am a former visiting student researcher at <b>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Section 312A)</b> and <b>Tokyo Metropolitan University</b>.

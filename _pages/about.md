I am an undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Aerospace Engineering (expected graduation: May 2023), currently intending to enter a Ph.D. program in Fall 2023. My research interests include space mission design (astrodynamics & space logistics), sequential decision-making (optimal control, reinforcement learning, etc.), and optimization under uncertainty.

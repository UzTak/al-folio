I am a Ph.D. student at <b>Stanford University, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</b>. 
Currently I am working at [Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory](https://slab.stanford.edu/), advised by Dr. Simone D'Amico. 
I have also been receiving a full-ride scholarship from [Ezoe Memorial Recruit Foundation](https://www.recruit-foundation.org/) since 2020.

初めまして！スタンフォード大学 航空宇宙学科博士課程1年の田久保勇志です。

My currente research interests include spacecraft autonomy & intelligence in the context of distributed space systems (formation flight, proximity operations, and docking (RPOD)).

Past Research Topics:
- Space Logistics (operations research in space) with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning / Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)
- Low-energy transfer in the Sun-Earth-Moon four-body system
- Tour trajectory design in the Multi-Moon System (Saturn & Jupiter)
- Robust guidance of Supersonic Transport 
- Optimal control in the probability moment space / Covariance Steering

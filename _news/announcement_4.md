I was re-selected to the Ezoe Memorial Recruit Scholar (江副記念リクルート財団) for the Ph.D. track! This Japanese private foundation has been providing me with huge financial support (full-ride tuition + living expense, up to 10M JPY (~=73k USD) /year since 2020, and will be potentially extended until March 2028. I am very much looking forward to continuing my academic pursuit in graduate school from Fall 2023, pushing the boundary of optimization, control, and space mission design.
